# 100 Days of Code
 This is the 100 Days of Code course on Udemy by Angela Yu. The purpose of this repository is to keep track of all the codes I have learnt & practiced from this course. And, share it so it can be helpful for anyone looking it up. I will uploading the code of all the projects that I finish from this course, as long as I am with this course and as far as I can go.
